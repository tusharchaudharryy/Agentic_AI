The foundation\\'s response was to improve the clarity of its explanations, make \"orientation calls\" to grantees upon awarding grants, tell grantees who their foundation contact is, give timely feedback when they receive a grantee report, and establish a way for grantees to provide anonymous or attributed feedback to the foundation. The foundation also launched a podcast series.\\nIn October 2013, the BMGF announced that it would join the International Aid Transparency Initiative.\\nIn December 2013, Susan Desmond-Hellmann, president of product development for Genentech before its'),\n",
